        <h1>scenario editor tutorial</h1>
        <p>the scenario editor allows you to arrange your frame's order
        <br>and their duration which will compose your movie.</p>

        <br>
        <p>here is a preview of the scenario editor element :</p>
        <img src="scenario_editor_frame.png" alt="scenario editor frame">
        <br>
        <h1>composition</h1>
        <p>the scenario editor is divided into 3 components :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>images list (WEST)</li>
            <li>timeline (SOUTH)</li>
            <li>selected timeline element preview (CENTER)</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>images list</h1>
        <p>the images list will show all the available images of your project.</p>
        <p><br>to add an element to the timeline you can either :
        <br>- right-click show the contextual menu and click on "add to timeline"
        <br>- drag the image of choice then drop it into the timeline.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>timeline</h1>
        <p>the timeline is where you can arrange your different frames.<br>
        there are different actions you can do on a timeline element :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>grab the green handle to manually adjust the element's duration.</li> 
            <li>right-clicking the element will present all the different actions available
                <ul>
                    <li>remove the element from the timeline.</li>
                    <li>change its duration.</li>
                    <li>move the element to its right or left.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>one of the main features of the timeline is the keyboard control.</b></p>
        <p><br>when you click an element, it will be selected (white highlight)
        <br>the selected element's image will then appear in the center preview.
        <br>
        <br>
        use the left and right arrow keys to select the next (or previous) element.
        <br>holding CTRL + arrow will move the element instead of moving the selection.
        <br>holding CTRL + SHIFT + arrow will change the element's duration by .05s
        <br>holding CTRL + SHIFT + ALT + arrow will change the elements duration by .1s</p>
